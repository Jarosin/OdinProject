<h2>Recipe of smoothie</h2>
<p>Blend blueberries, yogurt, orange juice, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a blender on low speed for 30 seconds; increase speed to high and blend until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add ice and blend on high until smooth, about 1 minute more.</p>
<h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
<p>If you want it less thick, add less ice. If you want it less cold, add less ice.</p>
<p>I do not recommend using regular yogurt, because it will make the smoothie super watery.</p>

<p>If you want it sweeter, try adding more orange juice first. If that doesn't do it, add another tablespoon of sugar or sweetener.</p>

<p>If you don't like vanilla, don't add it!</p>
